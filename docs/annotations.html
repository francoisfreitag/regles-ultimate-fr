The<br>WFDF Rules of Ultimate is the primary document outlining how to play the game of<br>Ultimate. However players may refer to these annotations to help determine the correct<br>way to apply the rules and resolve issues on the field.<br>The rules are written to be as comprehensive, clear, simple and accurate as possible.<br>However, it is not always easy for the average player to understand how to apply the rules<br>to every situation, so these annotations provide some common examples of how to apply<br>the rules.<br>In a refereed sport, referees or umpires have discretion on whether a breach makes a<br>material difference to the outcomes of the game. As ultimate is self-officiated, these<br>annotations also aim to establish common ground on what breaches would be considered<br>material.<br>Although the Official Annotations do not constitute part of the rules of the game, they are<br>conventions that should be followed in order to establish a common way of playing the<br>game, and if an example from this document is encountered on the field, the guidance of the<br>Official Annotations should be followed.<br>Where there is a discrepancy between an Appendix to the Rules of Ultimate and these<br>Official Annotations, the Appendix takes precedence.<br>Principles<br>The Rules of Ultimate are based on principles that outline how the game should be played<br>and how to resolve issues. When encountering a scenario that is not expressly described by<br>the rules, these principles are a good guide to help resolve the issue:<br>• It is trusted that no player will intentionally violate the rules; thus there are no harsh<br>penalties for inadvertent breaches, but rather a method for resuming play in a<br>manner which simulates what would most likely have occurred had there been no<br>breach.<br>• A team should not be disadvantaged because the opposition has made an error or<br>caused a breach.<br>• Calls should only be made where a breach has occurred that has a meaningful impact<br>on the game. Players should allow for a reasonable degree of tolerance for minor<br>breaches involving small discrepancies in distance and time.<br>• Not everybody sees a situation in the same light. Two players with a very good<br>view of a situation can still see very different things happening. Human perception<br>is not perfect. Players should be aware of this when trying to resolve calls.<br>• If a call cannot be resolved then the disc shall be returned to where possession was<br>last undisputed and play shall resume as it was prior to the call.<br>Note: Some of these annotations have been reprinted from the ‘2020-21 USA Ultimate<br>Official Rules of Ultimate’ with the permission of USA Ultimate.

<li>Spirit of the Game<br>1.1<br>Deliberate or egregious breach of the rules (1.2.1)<br>Note<br>Example<br>Result<br>Example<br>Result<br>Example<br>Result<br>1.2<br>Providing evidence to support a call (1.3.4)<br>What<br>Example<br>Why<br>Extra<br>1.3<br>Example<br>Example<br>What<br>Players should make calls without taking into account the context of the game. This<br>means that players should not start making more calls just because the game is nearly<br>over and the scores are quite close.<br>If at the start of the game minor travel infractions were not called, then they should<br>not be called later in the game.<br>Only calling significant breaches (1.3.10)<br>What<br>1.5<br>It is an essential component of good spirit that a player must be prepared, if asked,<br>to explain concisely the objective evidence that led to making a call, or contesting a<br>call.<br>After making a travel call, if asked, the defender might explain “I saw you lift your<br>pivot foot while the disc was still in your hand.”<br>The objective evidence is evidence that can be tested for validity. It makes it clear<br>that the call was not based on emotion or what the player wanted or expected to<br>happen, but what they actually observed.<br>If a player is not reasonably certain of the objective evidence, they should not make a<br>call.<br>Players should be aware and understanding of the language limitations accompanying<br>international play, however opponents should still be able to communicate, even<br>through gestures, what they saw. Team captains and team mates should get involved<br>if they think their team’s player is wrong or does not behave correctly.<br>Making calls in a consistent manner throughout the game (1.3.9)<br>What<br>1.4<br>For a breach to be considered egregious it should be considered a type of breach<br>that you would not normally expect within a standard game of Ultimate, or one for<br>which there is no reasonable justification within the rules.<br>A defender commits an egregious dangerous play that results in a foul against a<br>receiver who was attempting to gain possession of the disc in their attacking<br>endzone.<br>Captains may choose to allow the receiver to claim a goal, instead of the receiver<br>gaining possession and moving to the goal line.<br>A thrower deliberately travels to enable them to move past the marker and gain<br>yardage upwind on a turnover.<br>Captains may choose to treat the turnover location as the spot where the disc was<br>thrown.<br>A defender intentionally double teams the thrower, with no regard for any other<br>offensive players, and gets a block.<br>Captains may choose to return the disc to the thrower.<br>Players should allow for a reasonable degree of tolerance for minor breaches<br>involving small discrepancies in distance and time.<br>If the thrower established a pivot one centimetre away from the correct pivot<br>location then a travel infraction should not be called.<br>Intimidation (1.6.3)<br>A player could be deemed to be engaging in intimidating behaviour if, for example,<br>they yell loudly at an opponent with the intention of distracting the opponent as they<br>are about to make a catch. Simply undertaking a normal action within the game, such<br>as making a bid in front of someone, should not be seen as intimidation.<br>31.6<br>What<br>Result<br>1.7<br>Note<br>Disrespectful celebration after scoring (1.6.4)<br>This includes spiking directed at an opponent and taunting of the opponent by<br>“showing” them the disc. These actions must be avoided.<br>Opposing team captains and spirit captains should discuss all matters relating to<br>violations of spirit and try to resolve them.<br>Seeking perspective from non players (1.10)<br>It is still up to the players involved to make the final call. Non players must not<br>provide advice regarding a call unless they are requested to by a player involved.<br>If play has stopped, and a player is unable to make a call, for example due to injury or<br>language barriers, then a teammate may make a call on their behalf.<br>Teams may use a non-player as a translator to assist in communication during a<br>stoppage.<br>1.8<br>Note<br>Extra<br>1.9<br>Note<br>Use of Technology (1.10)<br>Players may view photographic or video footage of a call if it is available. However<br>play may not be unreasonably delayed for this purpose. See the Appendix for more<br>detail.<br>For example, live instant replay in a stadium setting may be used by players to<br>resolve a contested foul call. Players may not, however, request that a particular play<br>be replayed on the screen. If, after reviewing the video, players still cannot agree,<br>they should not delay the game to rewatch the play multiple times; instead, the play<br>should be treated as a regular contested foul. †<br>Calls by captains (1.11)<br>A captain should not make a call that stops play if they were not directly involved in<br>the play. However a captain can be involved in resolving any call once play has<br>already stopped.<br>1.10 Discussion of what occurred in a play (1.12)<br>Note<br>Before the disc is returned to the thrower when players cannot agree, players<br>should discuss what happened in the play. Both players involved should attempt<br>to clearly explain what they think happened and listen to the view of their<br>opponent, or other players with good perspective on the play.<br>If discussion is difficult due to a language barrier, then gestures or recreations of<br>the incident can be used to indicate what was experienced during the incident<br>(eg striking yourself across the back of the hand to show that your hand was hit<br>as you were trying to catch the disc). Teams may also use a non-player as a<br>translator to assist in communication during a stoppage.<br>There are times where an event happens where it is not possible to be<br>reasonably certain of exactly what happened (eg no one had a good view, or it<br>happened too quickly). There are also times where it can be difficult to<br>determine whether something ‘affected the play’. In those circumstance the disc<br>should be returned to the last non-disputed thrower.<br>Discussions should be as brief as possible with the preferred outcome being<br>either a retracted call, or an accepted call. However once it becomes clear that<br>no resolution will be reached, the disc should be returned to the last non-<br>disputed thrower. The suggested maximum length of a stoppage due to a<br>4discussion is forty-five (45) seconds). See the Appendix for additional timing<br>rules.</li>
<li>Playing Field<br>2.1<br>Note<br>Playing Field size (2.1)<br>The playing field is one hundred (100) metres long by thirty-seven (37) metres wide.<br>The playing field is broken up into a central zone that is sixty-four (64) metres long,<br>and two end zones that are eighteen (18) metres deep at each end of the central<br>zone.<br>All lines are between seventy-five (75) and one hundred and twenty (120) millimetres<br>wide, and are marked with a non-caustic material.<br>If space is not available to fit a full sized field, the end zones should be made shorter<br>before the central zone is reduced. Refer to the Appendix for more detail.<br>If there are no field markings, and the cones used to mark a sideline are not in a<br>straight line, the sideline line is deemed to be the line between the two cones of the<br>relevant zone the player is currently within. For example, if a player is close to the<br>sideline in the central zone, it is the cones on each goal line along that sideline that<br>are relevant. If a player is close to the sideline within an endzone, it is the cones at<br>the front and rear of that end zone along that sideline that are relevant.</li>
<li>Equipment<br>3.1<br>Note<br>3.2<br>Note<br>Harmful equipment should not be worn (3.4)<br>This includes wristwatches, bracelets, buckles and protruding jewellery. Fully<br>metallic studs, long studs and studs with sharp edges are not allowed on footwear.<br>Equipment that impedes ability to play (3.4)<br>This includes oversized items, long pieces of fabric etc. The types of gloves<br>commonly worn by Ultimate players are allowed, but they must not in any way<br>damage the disc or leave any residue on the disc</li>
<li>Point, Goal and Game<br>4.1<br>Note<br>4.2<br>Note<br>Timing of games (4.2)<br>Games can also be played with a Time Cap. Refer to the Appendix for more details.<br>Half time (4.3)<br>Half time usually lasts 7 minutes in games with a Time Cap of 100 minutes. Refer to<br>the Appendix for more details about Half time</li>
<li>Teams<br>5.1<br>Note<br>Mixed games (5.1)<br>In Mixed games, where men and women play on the same team, both teams should<br>have the same gender ratio as each other on the field for each point. Events should<br>use one of the options in the WFDF Rules of Ultimate Appendix to determine the<br>gender ratio for each point.<br>55.2<br>Note<br>Role of captain and spirit captain (5.2)<br>The team captain is a team member, who is eligible to participate in the game, and<br>has been designated to represent the team in decision-making on behalf of the team<br>before, during, and after a game.<br>The spirit captain is a team member, who is eligible to participate in the game, and<br>has been designated to address, discuss, and resolve spirit issues at any point<br>throughout the competition with opponents, teammates, coaches, and game or event<br>officials.</li>
<li>Starting a Game<br>6.1<br>Note<br>6.2<br>Note<br>Team representatives (6.1)<br>Team representatives should ensure they have the authority from their team to<br>make the decisions listed in this section.<br>Fairly determining choices (6.1)<br>It is recommended that team representatives use the process described in the<br>WFDF Rules of Ultimate Appendix to fairly determine the choices.</li>
<li>The Pull<br>7.1<br>Note<br>7.2<br>Note<br>7.3<br>Note<br>Reasonable delay before the pull (7.1.1)<br>The following activities are considered reasonable prior to a pull:<br>• Celebrating a goal<br>• Determining who will play the next point,<br>• Determining team tactics for that point, e.g.:<br>o who is marking whom<br>o offensive positions<br>o what type of defence and&#x2F;or offence will be used<br>As a guide, the pull should be released within 75 seconds of the start of the point<br>(which starts at the start of a half, or when the previous goal was scored). Refer to<br>the Appendix for more details that can apply at some events.<br>The puller (7.2)<br>The puller is the defender who undertakes the pull.<br>The pulling team may designate a new puller at any time before the pull. †<br>Signalling readiness (7.3, 7.4)<br>The offence should be legally positioned and all non-players from the offensive team<br>should be off the playing field before the offence can legally signal readiness.<br>All non-players from the defensive team should be off the playing field before the pull<br>is released.<br>7.4<br>Note<br>Calling Offside (7.5)<br>It is recommended that the opposing team provide a warning to the captain of the<br>team committing this violation before it is enforced. Team should also take into<br>account that calls should only be made where a breach is significant enough to make<br>a difference to the outcome of the action.<br>Offside can only be called by the players on the field, and any call made by a non-<br>player has no consequences. However non players may assist in monitoring offside<br>and may provide advice based on their perspective.<br>6A contested offsides call results in a stoppage of play and a re-pull.<br>To contest an offsides call, a player on the contesting team must have perspective at<br>least as good as the person making the call. If the call is made with the assistance of a<br>non-player, only a similarly-positioned person would be deemed to have equal or<br>better perspective.<br>7.5<br>Note<br>Resuming play after an Offside call (7.5)<br>There is no difference to whether a team has been called for their first offside<br>violation, or they have been called offside multiple times, the outcome is the same.<br>If either team has called offside, it is still a “dropped pull” turnover if the offence<br>touches the disc before it hits the ground, and the offensive team fails to<br>subsequently establish possession.<br>What If both teams are called for offside on the same pull, both outcomes described in<br>rules 7.5.1 and 7.5.2 would apply<br>The defence is offside and the offence calls offside after they catch the disc<br>Result The offside call has no bearing and play continues as if no offside has been called<br>What The defence is offside and the offence calls offside and then the disc is caught by the<br>offence<br>The offside call has no bearing and play continues as if no offside has been called<br>Result<br>What<br>Result<br>What<br>Result<br>What<br>Result<br>Extra<br>7.6<br>What<br>Result<br>Extra<br>The defence is offside and the offence calls offside and then the disc hits the ground<br>and stops in the offences defending endzone<br>The offence can pick up the disc and resume play from the brick mark closest to<br>their defending endzone. No check is required.<br>The offence is offside and the defence calls offside after the offence have caught the<br>disc<br>The offside call has no bearing and play continues as if no offside has been called<br>The offence is offside and the defence calls offside while the disc is in the air and the<br>pull lands out-of-bounds<br>The offence can still make a “brick” call. The thrower establishes a pivot at the brick<br>mark closest to their defending endzone. All other offence players establish a<br>stationary position. The defence then establish a stationary position. The disc is<br>checked in and play resumes.<br>If a player makes an incorrect offside call (ie by calling it after it has been touched, or<br>the offence calls offside and also catches the pull) and play had stopped to discuss the<br>call, players should return to where they were when the call was made and resume<br>play with a check.<br>Defence stops a pull from rolling (7.7)<br>A pull hits the ground and starts rolling towards the defending end zone, so a<br>defender stops the disc, even before an offence player has touched it.<br>This is allowed (Rule 8.4). If the defensive player kicked the disc towards the<br>offensive end zone, the disc may be put into play by the offence at the point where it<br>was kicked (Rule 8.4.1).<br>If the pull is still in the air without the offence having touched it, no defensive player<br>may touch it, even if it flies back towards the defensive end zone (e.g. because of the<br>wind). If a player does touch it, the offence may request a re-pull.<br>If the pull lands in the offence’s attacking end zone (i.e. a really short pull), the<br>offence should take it on the goal line.<br>7Any offence player can also stop the pull from rolling. That player is not required to<br>pick up the disc after stopping it.<br>7.7<br>Note<br>Extra<br>Brick call (7.12)<br>If an offensive player signals and calls “brick”, a different offensive player may pick up<br>the disc.<br>If players who had good perspective on the play cannot agree on if the pull landed<br>out-of-bounds or in-bounds, the midpoint on the sideline between the two proposed<br>pivot locations should be used.</li>
<li>State of Play<br>8.1<br>What<br>Result<br>Why<br>Extra<br>8.2<br>Note<br>Extra<br>8.3<br>Note<br>8.4<br>What<br>Result<br>8.5<br>What<br>Result<br>Why<br>Using the wrong call (8.1.3)<br>A player signals a foul or violation and yells “stop” or uses the incorrect name for a<br>call.<br>The call should be dealt with as if the player has used the correct call.<br>It is clear that the player has seen a breach of the rules. This takes precedence over<br>the technicality of knowing the correct term.<br>The player who used the wrong term should make it a point to learn the correct<br>term (rule 1.3.1) and more experienced players should tell them the correct call<br>(rule 1.8).<br>Disc hits the ground (8.1.4)<br>A disc is deemed to have hit the ground when it contacts the ground and no player<br>had caught the disc prior to the disc contacting the ground, or after the catch, the<br>player loses control and the disc subsequently contacts the ground.<br>After a pull or a turnover where the disc hits the ground in-bounds, if the offence<br>attempts to pick up the disc in-bounds, but fails to pick it up and the disc drops to the<br>ground, that is not a new turnover, unless the offence had full control of the disc<br>prior to accidentally dropping the disc.<br>Moving during dead play (8.1.5)<br>If, after an out-of-bounds turnover, the thrower is walking the disc to the playing<br>field, all other players are allowed to move.<br>Significantly altering the discs position (8.4)<br>In attempting to stop a rolling disc a player knocks the disc towards their attacking<br>endzone.<br>The opposition may request that the pivot be established at the location where the<br>disc was contacted, by verbal request or by pointing to the correct location. Play<br>does not stop and a check is not required to restart play (similar to an accepted<br>travel infraction (Rule 18.2.6)).<br>If the offensive team is the team that significantly altered the discs position they<br>should not move to establish the pivot at the location where the disc was contacted<br>unless requested to by the opposition.<br>Standing over the disc after a turnover (8.5)<br>A turnover has occurred and the new intended thrower is standing over the disc,<br>waiting for their team to set up<br>The defence should remind the player they need to put the disc into play.<br>Intentional delay of game is against spirit of the game and should be discussed by the<br>captains as soon as possible.<br>Rule 8.5 says that the new thrower must not delay when picking up the disc.<br>8Extra<br>8.6<br>If other players are still moving towards the disc (a common situation after a<br>turnover), the closest player can decide not to pick up the disc – this is not in itself a<br>breach of the rules. If no player on offense has been walking towards the disc since<br>the turnover occurred, this is a breach of the rules.<br>It is recommended that the opposing team provide a warning to the opposition and<br>make sure they are aware of the rule before enforcing any time limits.<br>Time limits after a turnover (8.5.1)<br>Note<br>Extra<br>8.7<br>Note<br>To enforce the 10 and 20 second time limits the defence should use a Pre-stall, by<br>loudly counting down the time limit in 5-second intervals. The Pre-stall should be<br>noticeable by the offence player closest to the disc. The player who calls the time<br>limits does not need to be the same player who becomes the marker.<br>If the disc lands out-of-bounds and then rolls back and stops in the playing field, the<br>time limits in 8.5.1 do not apply (unless games are using the WFDF Rules of Ultimate<br>Appendix)<br>For events where the WFDF Rules of Ultimate Appendix are in use, the time limits<br>also apply to discs that are out-of-bounds, and for the pull.<br>It is recommended that the opposing team provide a warning to the opposition and<br>make sure they are aware of the rule before enforcing any time limits.<br>If the offence believes that the time limits are being counted too quickly, they can call<br>a fast count.<br>The defence must allow an unobstructed path by the offence to the disc and to the<br>pivot location.<br>Starting a stall count after a delay of game (8.5.2.1)<br>After the “delay of game” call the offence should be given two (2) seconds to remedy<br>the breach before the stall count is commenced</li>
<li>Stall Count<br>9.1<br>Note<br>9.2<br>What<br>Result<br>Extra<br>Note<br>Clearly communicating the stall count (9.2)<br>The stall count will usually be communicated verbally for stall count. Teams can<br>agree on other methods to suit particular circumstances.<br>When to start the stall count (9.3)<br>The marker can start the stall count as soon as the thrower has caught the disc<br>(excluding after an interception).<br>Even if the thrower still has to stop, get up after a dive, or even come back into the<br>field because they ran out of the field, the marker may start the count.<br>If the offensive player needs some time to recover because they had to avoid an<br>object outside the field (for safety, there shouldn’t be any, but in practice this may be<br>the case) the marker should not count until the player has had that time.<br>If the thrower regains possession of an accidentally dropped disc before it contacts<br>the ground without another player touching the disc, that possession is considered<br>continuous. If the thrower regains possession of an accidentally dropped disc before<br>it contacts the ground and after another player touches it, it is considered a new<br>possession.<br>If the thrower catches a pass in the central zone, but momentum takes them out-of-<br>bounds, the marker can start&#x2F;continue the stall count if they are within 3 metres of<br>the pivot location, even if they are not within 3 metres of the thrower.<br>After an interception by Team A, the marker from Team B cannot start the stall<br>count until the thrower from Team A establishes a pivot, regardless of whether the<br>thrower is in-bounds or out-of-bounds after the interception.<br>If the intercepting player catches the disc while running, the marker must wait until<br>they stop and establish a pivot before starting the stall count.<br>99.3<br>Note<br>9.4<br>What<br>Result<br>What<br>Result<br>9.5<br>What<br>Result<br>9.6<br>What<br>Extra<br>Note<br>Other calls (9.5.4)<br>All other calls includes:<br>• Contested foul<br>• Contested goal<br>• Contested turnover (excluding stall-out)<br>• Violation for sideline obstruction (2.7)<br>• Injury<br>• Technical<br>Call involving the thrower and receiving breach (9.5.4.1)<br>A contested stall out is called against the thrower after the disc has been thrown. A<br>contested receiving foul is called on the resulting pass.<br>The disc is returned to the thrower and, as per Rule 9.5.4.1, the stall count restarts<br>at “Stalling 8”.<br>An accepted marking foul is called by the thrower as the disc is released. A<br>contested receiving foul is called on the resulting pass.<br>The disc is returned to the thrower and, as per Rule 9.5.4.1, the stall count restarts<br>at “Stalling 1”.<br>Stall count after check violation (9.5.4.2)<br>Play has stopped due to an accepted foul by the thrower. The stall count is going to<br>restart at “Stalling 8”. The defence moves before the check and a violation is called<br>by the offence.<br>Even though this is a breach by the defence, Rule 9.5.4.2 means that the stall count<br>will still restart at “Stalling 8”.<br>Stall counts (9.6)<br>If, after a call, a stall count is to be restarted at maximum 6 and:</li>
<li>the stall count was stopped at 4, the stall count restarts on “Stalling 5”</li>
<li>the stall count was stopped at 8, the stall count restarts on “Stalling 6”<br>There does not need to be a gap between “stalling” and the number of the count.<br>If there is a disagreement that cannot be resolved about what number the stall count<br>should restart on, the midpoint between the two proposed stall counts should be<br>used, rounded down.</li>
<li>The Check<br>10.1 When a check is not required (10.1)<br>Note<br>Extra<br>A check is not required after the pull or after a turnover, even when the thrower<br>must walk to the location of the correct pivot point. The thrower can make a pass,<br>and the marker can start the stall count, as soon as the pivot is established at the<br>correct position.<br>If the pivot is not established at the correct position, this is a travel infraction.<br>If the marker starts the stall count before the pivot is established, this is a fast count<br>infraction.<br>To ensure play is not interrupted, it is recommended that either the thrower or<br>marker point to the spot where they think the pivot should be established, prior to<br>it being established.<br>The thrower may not begin a wind-up or other part of the throwing motion until<br>they have established a pivot point (see rule 18.2.5.3).<br>“Specified turnover” refers to those listed in 13.2<br>1010.2 Positioning after a call (10.2.2.1)<br>Note<br>If a long pass is thrown and there is a contested receiving foul, the players will return<br>to where they were at the time of the throw (rather than remaining downfield after<br>chasing down the disc). †<br>10.3 Faulty Equipment (10.3)<br>Note<br>Faulty equipment includes, for example, untied shoelaces, a bent disc or a shoe that<br>has come off. However, it is players’ responsibility to minimise such disruptions by<br>ensuring their personal equipment is secure.<br>10.4 “Delay of Game” for a check (10.5)<br>What<br>Result<br>Extra<br>Note<br>An unnecessary delay includes discussing team tactics (who is guarding whom, who<br>should attempt to catch the next pass).<br>An unnecessary delay includes standing back from the disc, wandering around to gain<br>more time, etc. Pretending not to delay while delaying is still delaying. †<br>A discussion to resolve the outcome of a call is not an unnecessary delay.<br>After a “Delay of Game” called against the defence where the unnecessary delay<br>continues, the thrower may call “Disc In” and then immediately make a pass.<br>The person checking the disc in must still ensure that all players are stationary and in<br>the correct position before checking the disc in.<br>It is recommended that the opposing team provide a warning to the opposition, and<br>make sure they are aware of the rule, before enforcing this rule.<br>10.5 Preferred process for checking the disc in (10.6)<br>Note<br>Extra<br>It is recommended that the following steps be undertaken before checking the disc<br>in:<br>• “Is the offence ready?”<br>• “Is the defense ready?”<br>• “The stall count is starting on ‘x’”<br>• “Disc In, in 3…2…1”<br>• Touch the disc, touch the disc to the ground, or say “Disc In”, as appropriate<br>If the defender is required to touch the disc to check the disc in, the defense must<br>actively choose to touch the disc – the thrower cannot initiate the check by tapping<br>the disc against the defender.<br>10.6 Losing possession on ground touch (10.6.1.2)<br>Note<br>If the thrower loses possession as a result of touching the disc to the ground, they<br>can re-establish possession.<br>10.7 Calling a violation for moving prior to the check or incorrect<br>positioning (10.7)<br>Note<br>A player cannot call a violation as per rule 10.7 because a player on their own team<br>(including themselves) is in the wrong position, or is moving before the check.</li>
<li>Out-of-Bounds<br>11.1 The “Greatest Play in the World” (11.3.1.)<br>What<br>Result<br>Why<br>An offensive player realises that they cannot catch the disc in-bounds and jumps from<br>an in-bounds position, catches the disc and throws it before they land out-of-bounds.<br>This is a valid pass.<br>Rule 11.3.1. states that an airborne player who jumped from in-bounds is still in-<br>bounds. This lasts until the player lands out-of-bounds and by that time the player<br>has already released the disc. Therefore, the disc is not out.<br>11Extra<br>A player is allowed to throw the disc while in the air, according to rule 18.2.1.1.<br>A player may not catch their own “greatest” throw, unless it is touched by another<br>player before the thrower catches it, as per rule 13.2.5.<br>If there is a contested call regarding the catch after a “greatest”, the player who<br>threw the “greatest” should be treated as the last thrower. They should establish a<br>pivot at the point on the field closest to where they released the disc (or on the goal<br>line if this would result in a pivot in their attacking end zone).<br>11.2 What to call when in or out (11.4)<br>Note<br>Extra<br>If an opponent believes an offensive player has caught the disc out-of-bounds they<br>should make a call immediately by saying “Out-of-bounds” or “Out” for short.<br>“Check feet” is a not a call and this call does not stop play.<br>The player making the “Out” call should be reasonably certain that the plyer was out<br>otherwise they should not make the call.<br>If it is unclear if the player was out-of-bounds then play should stop as the players<br>with best perspective discuss the call. Players may ask for perspective from people<br>on the side-line, however it is still up to the players involved to make the final call.<br>If the call is contested the disc shall be returned to the previous thrower.<br>For games played on unlined fields the receiver should be given the benefit of the<br>doubt for close “Out-of-bounds” calls.<br>11.3 Catch close to the sideline (11.4)<br>What<br>Result<br>Why<br>Extra<br>A player catches a pass very close to the sideline and then goes out of bounds and<br>establishes possession<br>As long as the player catches the pass (by having a non-spinning disc trapped<br>between at least two body parts) while also being in contact with the in-bounds area<br>(and not being in contact with the out-of-bounds area) this is an in-bounds reception.<br>Rules 11.3.2 means that once the player has caught the disc, they can go out of<br>bounds, as long as they maintain the catch until they establish possession.<br>If the player who caught the disc in-bounds does contact out-of-bounds, and then<br>fumbles the disc before they establish possession, that is an out-of-bounds turnover,<br>regardless of whether or not they regain possession before the disc hits the ground.<br>11.4 Receiving contacting out-of-bounds (11.4.1)<br>Note<br>If the receiver’s feet are in-bounds, but their hair or clothing is touching the ground<br>out-of-bounds, they are considered out-of-bounds.<br>11.5 Leaving the playing field (11.7)<br>Note<br>Extra<br>Players are allowed to leave the playing field to make a play on the disc and may re-<br>enter the field at any point. However it is a turnover if an offensive player jumps<br>from out-of-bounds and contacts the disc before they contact the playing field (Rule<br>11.3.1&#x2F; 11.6&#x2F; 13.1.3).<br>It is bad spirit to intentionally leave the playing field and use players&#x2F;objects on the<br>sideline to disguise your location.<br>11.6 Disc goes out of bounds (11.8)<br>What<br>Result<br>A long throw from the sideline doesn’t come back in field. Where do you set your<br>pivot correctly and continue to play?<br>A defender is always in bounds when making a play on the disc (11.2). This means<br>that if a defender touches the disc whilst out of bounds – the disc is then played<br>from nearest point on the central zone (11.8.2). Note: if a defender hits the disc but<br>the wind takes the disc back in field - the play is still live.<br>12Offensive players can become out of bounds (11.6). This means in the same situation<br>if offence touches the disc first then it is a turnover and the disc goes back to where<br>it crossed the perimeter line (i.e. was last in-bounds). (11.8.1).<br>Note<br>Extra<br>If an offensive player jumps from in-bounds and touches the disc before landing, then<br>that establishes a point where the disc was in-bounds. If this results in a turnover<br>,without the receiver ever establishing possession, the disc will come into play at the<br>point nearest to where the offensive player touched the disc. If the receiver catches<br>the pass and throws it while in the air, and the disc lands in-bounds, then that<br>establishes the disc as being back in-bounds.<br>If players who had good perspective on the play cannot agree on where the disc<br>went out-of-bounds, the midpoint between the two proposed locations should be<br>used.<br>If a defender jumps, intercepts a pass, and then lands out-of-bounds, this is not a<br>“double turnover” - the defender still retains possession.<br>11.7 Non-player retrieving an out-of-bounds disc (11.9)<br>What<br>Result<br>Extra<br>Note<br>A non-player retrieves an out-of-bounds disc and returns it to the thrower who is<br>standing on the perimeter line.<br>Rule 11.9 allows non-players to retrieve the disc, however the thrower must carry<br>the disc the last 3 metres. Therefore the thrower should walk 3 metres away from<br>the field and then return. They may then establish a pivot at the correct spot and<br>continue play.<br>If the thrower commences play without going 3 metres away the opposition may call<br>violation and play will restart with a check.<br>However if the opposition does not feel they have been disadvantaged by the disc<br>being returned to the thrower, they can allow play to continue.<br>Non-players may also stop an out-of-bounds rolling disc that is more than 3 metres<br>from the pivot point.<br>The team in possession may choose to substitute a disc if the disc is out-of-bounds,<br>and it will save time to substitute it. The thrower must still carry the disc the last 3<br>metres to the field. The thrower should notify the nearest defender if they are<br>substituting the disc.<br>Non-players should not intentionally touch a disc until it has become out-of-bounds.</li>
<li>Receivers and Positioning<br>12.1 Catching the disc (12.1)<br>Note<br>Extra<br>The rules have been updated since 2017 to mean that “catch” and “possession” no<br>longer mean the same thing. A “catch” is when the disc is first controlled by the<br>receiver. Once a player has caught the disc, they can go out-of-bounds, or have the<br>disc touch the ground, and this is not a turnover, as long as they maintain the catch<br>while out-of-bounds or while the disc is touching the ground, and they subsequently<br>establish possession of the pass.<br>A player establishes possession of a pass when:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>they catch a pass and then they maintain that catch for more than one<br>noticeable instant, and</li>
<li>they maintain the catch throughout all ground contact related to the catch, or<br>until they throw the disc<br>For a disc to be considered “trapped” the disc must be held firmly between at least<br>two body parts and should not move relative to those two body parts.<br>If a player initially catches a pass and then, prior to establishing possession, they do<br>not maintain the catch (‘maintain the catch’ means to continue to have a non-<br>spinning disc trapped between at least two body parts), that initial catch is deemed<br>13to have ended<br>A player may change the body parts that are being used to trap the disc, and as long<br>as the disc continues to be trapped by at least two of the body parts during that<br>change, it is considered the same catch (for example if a player traps the disc to their<br>chest with their right hand, they can grab the disc by the rim with their left hand and<br>take the disc away from their chest, and as long as they only remove their right hand<br>once the left hand has grabbed the disc, it is considered the same catch).<br>12.2 Related to the catch (12.1.1)<br>Note<br>Ground contact or contact with another player can be deemed to be ‘related to the<br>catch’ if it occurs directly after the catch has been made, is a result of landing after<br>diving to catch the disc, or occurs while the player is off-balance after catching the<br>disc. If, for example, a player takes a running catch in the end zone, subsequently<br>establishes possession through the first few steps after the catch, and then continues<br>to run as part of a celebration and trips over, any loss of possession that occurs as a<br>result of the celebration would not be deemed to be ‘related to the catch’. One way<br>to distinguish if the contact is related to the catch is that once the player could have<br>chosen to stop moving and be stationary and in control of their movement, any<br>further actions are not related to the catch, even if they do not choose to come to a<br>stop.<br>12.3 Moving in a reckless manner (12.5)<br>Note<br>This could include running without looking where you are going for an extended<br>period of time, or diving in a way that does not allow you to adjust to any legal<br>changes of movement that an opponent might make.<br>12.4 Player positioning (12.5)<br>What<br>Extra<br>Note<br>Player A, who is making a play on the disc, is allowed to slow down and to impede an<br>opponent’s movement to make a play on the disc. However Player A must not<br>move in a way that the opponent could not reasonably avoid them – this is a<br>Blocking foul (17.4).<br>Some minor contact may occur in these circumstances but minor contact is not a<br>foul.<br>If Player A is not making a play at the disc, but is instead allowing a teammate to<br>make a play at the disc, Player A may not move to impede an opponent. However if<br>Player A is stationary, or does not intend to impede, this is not a violation, even if<br>their actions do in fact impede an opponent.<br>The key word in this rule is ‘solely’. The intent of the player’s movement can be<br>partly motivated to prevent an opponent from taking an unoccupied path to the disc,<br>so long as it is part of a general effort to make a play on the disc.<br>If a trailing player runs into a player in front of them, it is nearly always a foul on the<br>trailing player.<br>After a turnover, and&#x2F;or whenever a thrower is not at the pivot location, the<br>defence must allow an unobstructed path by the offence to the disc and&#x2F;or to the<br>pivot location<br>12.5 Making a play on the disc (12.6)<br>Note<br>A player can be deemed to be “making a play on the disc” (Rule 12.6) when the disc<br>is in the air and they are attempting to make contact with the disc in any way e.g. to<br>catch it or block it.<br>When making a play at a disc, players need to ensure that they will not cause non<br>minor contact with another player (neither their stationary position, nor their<br>expected position based on their established speed and direction), before, during or<br>after the attempt at the disc.<br>14Minor contact is contact that involves minimal physical force and does not alter the<br>movements or position of another player.<br>If non-minor contact does occur, the result of the play will likely not stand if the<br>breach affected the play.<br>A breach affects the play if it is reasonable to assume that the outcome of the<br>specific play may have been meaningfully different had the breach not occurred – eg if<br>the player would not have been able to intercept the pass without causing significant<br>contact with their opponent, or the opponent would have been able to make a play<br>at the disc had the player not caused contact with them.<br>The relative skill, height and&#x2F;or athletic ability, of the players involved should not<br>typically be taken into account when considering if something affected the play or<br>not.<br>12.6 Resting a hand on an opponent (12.6)<br>What<br>Result<br>Why<br>A defender is resting a hand in their opponents back to enable them to know where<br>their opponent is, even if they are not looking at them<br>This is a violation.<br>It is not necessarily a foul, but it is a violation as per rule 15.1.1 which says “a player<br>intentionally initiating minor contact is still a breach of the rules, but is to be treated<br>as a violation, and not a foul.”<br>12.7 Player positioning when the disc is in the air (12.6 – 12.9)<br>What<br>Result<br>Why<br>What<br>Result<br>Why<br>What<br>Result<br>Why<br>Extra<br>What<br>Result<br>Why<br>Player A is chasing after the disc and slows down to ensure they can remain between<br>Player B and the disc.

Player B runs into the back of Player A. Player A catches the disc.<br>Player B has fouled Player A. Player A has possession so does not need to make a<br>call, or must call “play on” if they had made a call.<br>Player A is allowed to slow down and to impede a player’s movement to make a play<br>on the disc. Player B could have reasonably avoided Player A and is therefore<br>initiating contact.<br>Impeding a player’s movement is different from initiating contact.<br>Some minor contact may occur in these circumstances but minor contact is not a<br>foul.<br>Player A and Player B are teammates and are chasing after the disc. Player B slows<br>down and moves from side to side to prevent an opponent, Player C, from getting<br>around them and making a play at the disc. Player A catches the disc.<br>Player C can call a violation against Player B.<br>Player B is not making a play for the disc. Player C is making a play on the disc and<br>therefore Player B is not allowed to intentionally impede their movement.<br>15Extra If Player B is stationary they are allowed to remain there, even if that impedes Player<br>C’s attempt to make a play at the disc. However if Player B sticks out their arms to<br>impede Player C – that is still considered a movement to impede Players C’s<br>movements and is a violation.<br>What Player A is stationary and waiting to catch the disc. Player B is running towards<br>Player A, then jumps, intercepts the pass, and then collides with Player A<br>Player B has fouled Player A.<br>Rule 12.6 expressly says that making a play for the disc is not a valid excuse for<br>initiating contact with other players.<br>When making a play at a disc, players need to insure that they will not cause an<br>unavoidable collision with another player’s position, if stationary, or their established<br>speed and direction, before, during or after the attempt at the disc.<br>Result<br>Why<br>Extra<br>What<br>Result<br>Why<br>Player A is stationary and waiting to catch the disc. Player B is running and then<br>jumps in a way that would avoid player A and intercepts the pass. Player A moves<br>into Player B’s path while Player B is in the air. There is contact between Player A<br>and Player B.<br>Player A has fouled Player B.<br>Player A has initiated contact by moving to a position that a moving opponent will be<br>unable to avoid. This is a blocking foul.<br>12.8 Moving towards a single point simultaneously (12.8)<br>What<br>Result<br>Why<br>Two opposing players are moving towards the same point in order to make a play on<br>the disc. They are both aware of each other and are aware that minor body contact<br>may occur. Minor body contact does occur.<br>Even though contact has occurred, this is not necessarily a foul.<br>In circumstances where one player clearly initiates contact with another, the person<br>who initiates the contact is the person who caused the foul (ie one player is<br>stationary and another runs into them, or one player clearly has a right to a space<br>and an opponent changes direction and impedes that space in an unavoidable way).<br>However there are times when both players have a right to a space and neither<br>player can be deemed to have initiated contact. In these circumstances, if minor body<br>contact occurs (ie players lightly bump shoulders or hips) this is not necessarily<br>deemed a foul, as both players were responsible for causing the contact and both<br>players were aware that contact may occur.<br>Scenario 1:<br>Both players caused the contact and only minor body contact occurs.<br>Result:<br>The result of the play should stand.<br>Scenario 2:<br>Both players cause contact but the body contact is not minor (ie causes a player<br>to fall over).<br>Result:<br>This is a foul by both players and it to be treated as an Offsetting Foul (17.9.2).<br>The disc shall be returned to the thrower.<br>Scenario 3:<br>Both players cause body contact and only minor body contact occurs. However<br>one player hits the arms of the other as they make a play for the disc<br>Result:<br>Even though both players caused body contact, the player who initiated contact<br>with the arms has caused a foul as this is not minor contact.<br>16Extra<br>These scenarios should only be taken into account when both players have caused<br>contact simultaneously. If one player clearly initiated the contact, that player has<br>caused the foul.<br>If one player is not aware that contact is going to occur, the player who is aware that<br>contact will occur should avoid the contact and call a Dangerous Play foul if<br>appropriate.<br>As per rule 17.9.2.1 if this contact occurs after the disc has been caught, or after the<br>relevant player&#x2F;s involved can no longer make a play on the disc, this must be treated<br>as an Indirect Foul (excluding contact related to Section 17.1).<br>Players involved in these incidents should be mindful that they often do not have the<br>best perspective on who initiated the contact and should ask nearby players for their<br>perspective.<br>12.9 Assisting a players movement or using equipment (12.10)<br>Note<br>If an offense player physically assists the movement of another, or uses an item of<br>equipment to assist in contacting the disc, this is a turnover – see rules 13.2.6, and<br>13.2.7.<br>If a defender physically assists the movement of a team-mate, or uses an item of<br>equipment to assist in contacting the disc (e.g. throwing a hat in the direction of the<br>disc), this is a violation. The intended receiver should be awarded possession.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="13">
<li>Turnovers<br>13.1 Disc down while not in possession of an offensive player (13.1.1)<br>Note<br>It is not a turnover if a player fumbles the disc prior to fully establishing possession<br>when attempting to gain possession of the disc after a turnover, or after a pull that<br>has already contacted the ground (see rule 8.1.4).<br>13.2 Disc contacting the ground while in control of an offensive player<br>(13.1.1.1)<br>Note<br>If a receiver dives to receive a pass and catches the disc before it hits the ground, the<br>disc can contact the ground after that, and still be “up”, as long as the player<br>maintains the catch while the disc is touching the ground. The receiver can change<br>the body parts that are being used to trap the disc, and as long as the disc continues<br>to be trapped by at least one of those sets of body parts during that change, it is<br>considered the same catch. If the receiver has pinched the disc between their fingers,<br>and when the disc hits the ground it caused the disc to move and to no longer be<br>pinched in the same spot, that is not a ‘maintained catch’ and therefore a turnover.<br>If, after catching a disc that then contacts the ground, the receiver subsequently loses<br>control while the disc is no longer touching the ground, the earlier catch is not<br>negated - the disc can still be caught by any player.<br>13.3 Interception turnover (13.1.2)<br>Note<br>Extra<br>If a defender from Team A intercepts a pass while airborne and throws the disc<br>before the contact the ground, and the pass is incomplete, that is a turnover by<br>Team A and Team B would become the team is possession.<br>A defender can intentionally hit a pass towards their endzone, but if they<br>subsequently contact the disc before it hits the ground, this is a travel as per rule<br>18.2.5.5<br>1713.4 Contested dropped pull (13.1.4)<br>Note<br>If a “dropped pull” is contested the pulling team may choose to repeat the pull or<br>retract the call.<br>13.5 Self-catch turnovers (13.2.5)<br>What<br>Result<br>Why<br>Extra<br>The thrower accidentally releases the disc while pivoting, and then catches it again,<br>without any other player touching the disc.<br>This is not a self-catch turnover. The marker can continue the stall count. If the<br>thrower has moved their pivot foot a travel infraction can be called.<br>A self-catch turnover can only occur after the thrower has attempted a pass. A pass<br>is defined (under Throw) as “A disc in flight following any throwing motion, including<br>after a fake attempt and an intentionally dropped disc, that results in loss of contact<br>between the thrower and the disc”. As the disc was not in flight after a throwing<br>motion or fake attempt, no pass has occurred and therefore 13.2.5 does not apply.<br>If the disc is accidentally released during the throwing motion as part of a fake<br>attempt, the thrower cannot catch the disc unless it has been touched by another<br>player.<br>The thrower may touch a disc they have thrown, for example to prevent an<br>opponent from catching it, or to tap it to a teammate.<br>If the thrower does catch their own pass, the turnover location is where the<br>thrower is when they caught the pass.<br>13.6 Assisting a team-mate’s movement (13.2.6)<br>Note<br>A player is prohibited from intentionally pushing off of a teammate to jump higher. †<br>13.7 Contesting a “stall-out” turnover (13.4)<br>Note<br>A “stall out” turnover should typically only be contested by the thrower<br>If the stall count was fast from 1-5, but then the correct speed for the remainder of<br>the count, the thrower cannot contest the stall-out on the grounds that is was a fast<br>count.<br>13.8 Continuing play after an accepted “stall out” (13.4)<br>Note<br>Extra<br>The marker from Team A calling the stall out gets the disc where the stall occurred<br>and then may either:<br>(1) place the disc on the ground. After acknowledgment by Team A, the former<br>thrower from Team B loudly announces “Disc in”, or<br>(2) retain the disc and have the former thrower from Team B restart play with a<br>check<br>A marker should not automatically call “stall-out” because they got to the count of<br>ten. They should be certain that the disc was not yet released and that their count<br>wasn’t fast. †<br>13.9 Ground stripped interception (13.5.1)<br>Note<br>If, in attempting to intercept a pass, a defender from Team A loses control of the<br>disc due to ground contact, or accidentally drops the disc, then possession is deemed<br>to have not been established and any player on Team A may take possession of the<br>disc.<br>13.10 Intentionally dropped disc (13.6)<br>What<br>Player A intercepts a pass and then intentionally drops the disc, or places the disc on<br>the ground to allow their teammate to become the thrower.<br>18Result<br>Extra<br>Note<br>Player A retrieves an out-of-bounds disc and then intentionally drops the disc at the<br>location of the intended pivot to allow their teammate to become the thrower.<br>This is not a “double turnover”. The opposition can call a Violation in which case<br>play stops and Player A must take possession of the disc. Play must restart with a<br>check.<br>However if Player A attempts a pass directly after the interception, and this pass is<br>incomplete, this is a turnover.<br>If there is any uncertainty as to whether the players’ loss of possession was due to<br>attempting to allow a teammate to become the thrower, or that they were in fact<br>attempting a pass that was incomplete, the player should be given the benefit of the<br>doubt.<br>13.11 Where to establish a pivot foot – disc out-of-bounds (13.8)<br>Note<br>Extra<br>The official spot is just next to the line (since the line is not part of the playing field),<br>but a pivot foot on the line is also acceptable. Given the fact that perimeter lines are<br>only a few centimetres wide, the “error” is too small to be significant. While the<br>rules state that the pivot point should be established in-bounds, rule 11.3.3 also<br>indicates that it is not a problem that the pivot foot contacts an out-of-bounds area.<br>If the disc flew out the side of the end zone, there is a cone on the spot where the<br>pivot point should be established. Rule 2.6 states that the edge of the central zone<br>must be marked by that cone, so the player should not move it. Therefore the pivot<br>point should be established on the end zone line next to the cone. Players should<br>not move the cone. Note that the player is allowed to have enough room to turn<br>on their pivot foot (otherwise unsafe situations might occur during pivoting).<br>13.12 Where to establish a pivot foot after a turnover – disc in-bounds (13.9)<br>What<br>Result<br>Why<br>Extra<br>A disc is turned over and the pivot is to be established in the Central Zone.<br>The thrower should pick up the disc and place the pivot at the spot of the disc. †<br>Rule 13.9 tells the thrower to establish a pivot at the turnover location.<br>The pivot should be as close to the disc’s location as possible. Players should not<br>place their right foot at the turnover location and then use their left foot as their<br>pivot. This is a travel infraction (18.2.5.1)<br>13.13 Hand signal after a turnover in defending end zone (13.11.2.1)<br>Note<br>Extra<br>The goal line signal can be useful to communicate to all players that the goal line<br>option will be taken. If the signal is made, the thrower must move to the goal line.<br>However it is a voluntary signal. The intended thrower may still establish the pivot at<br>the goal line even if they do not signal the goal line option.<br>The defence may ask the intended thrower if they intend to choose the goal line<br>option and it is good spirit to provide a response (via hand signal), however it is not<br>required.<br>If the player is establishing a pivot point at the goal line the player may carry the disc<br>at a constant or variable speed, and must move at walking pace or faster. †<br>The player must put the disc into play either at the spot of the disc or on the goal<br>line, not in between. †<br>13.14 Establishing a pivot foot after a turnover in defending end zone<br>(13.11.3)<br>Note<br>If the thrower breaches rule 13.11.3, this should be treated as a travel infraction.

<li>Scoring<br>14.1 “Callahan” Goals (14.1)<br>What<br>Result<br>Why<br>Extra<br>The offence throws the disc, but a defender intercepts the pass in the Offence’s<br>defending end zone (which is the Defence’s attacking end zone).<br>The defence scores a goal.<br>Rule 14.1 states that the goal is scored when a player catches a legal pass and the<br>first contact with the ground is inside their attacking endzone. It does not state that<br>the pass has to be from a teammate.<br>The term Callahan Goal is an unofficial term for this type of goal.<br>14.2 Throwing the disc after a score (14.1)<br>What<br>Result<br>Why<br>Note<br>Extra<br>A player catches the disc in the attacking end zone, but does not know this and<br>throws the disc.<br>It is a goal, no matter the result of the additional pass.<br>Rule 14.1 does not say that the player scoring the goal must be aware of it. So if<br>somebody has a clear perspective on it and declares it a goal, it is a goal. The disc<br>cannot be thrown away after a goal is scored, so that action can be disregarded.<br>If it is unclear if the player scored (ie there is no agreement on the player who had<br>best perspective, and there are opposing view points on the play) the result of the<br>additional play stands.<br>Players may ask for perspective from people on the side-line to determine if the pass<br>was caught in the endzone, however it is still up to the players involved to make the<br>final call.<br>If the player throws an incomplete pass after catching the disc in the endzone, but<br>before they survived all ground contact related to the catch, this is a turnover.<br>Everyone else can move as the thrower moves to the goal line after not scoring but<br>being in the endzone<br>14.3 Catching a goal (14.1)<br>Note<br>Extra<br>If a player in the endzone claps the disc between their hands, gains control of the<br>disc for just one moment, and then loses control and the disc hits the ground this is<br>known as a “clap spike”. A “clap spike” is not a goal as the player has not maintained<br>the catch for more than one noticeable instant and therefore, according to the<br>definitions, has not established possession of a pass.<br>If a player catches a pass in the end zone while running and maintains the catch for<br>more than one noticeable incident, and they survive any ground contact directly<br>related to the catch, they may deliberate release the disc as they continue to run.<br>14.4 Catching a goal close to the sideline (14.1)<br>What<br>Result<br>Extra<br>A player catches a pass in the end zone and very close to the sideline and then goes<br>out of bounds and establishes possession<br>As long as the player catches the pass (by having a non-spinning disc trapped<br>between at least two body parts) while also being in contact with the end zone (and<br>not being in contact with the out-of-bounds area) this is a goal.<br>If the player who caught the disc in the end-zone does contact out-of-bounds, and<br>then fumbles the disc before they establish possession, that is an out-of-bounds<br>turnover, regardless of whether or not they regain possession before the disc hits<br>the ground<br>2014.5 Contacting the end zone (14.1.1)<br>Note<br>If a player clearly lands on their toes first and then continues down onto their heels,<br>their toes are the first point of ground contact. If a player lands fairly flat-footed and<br>it is not possible to determine which part of the foot contacted the ground first, the<br>entire foot is the first point of ground contact. †<br>Remember, the end zone line is not part of the end zone. †<br>14.6 Contested Goal (14.2)<br>Note<br>Extra<br>After a contested or retracted goal call where the receiver maintains possession, all<br>players should return to where they were when the player established possession of<br>the pass.<br>If a player could reasonably assume that they have scored a goal, and behaves as if<br>they have scored a goal (for example, by celebrating a goal) this should be treated as<br>a “goal” call. This “goal” call is a stoppage of play and the result of any additional play<br>does not stand.<br>14.7 Goal call and time cap (14.4)<br>Note<br>If there is discussion about a goal, and after discussion the goal is confirmed, for the<br>purposes of time cap rules, the point is deemed to have ended when the player<br>established possession and the player in possession was in contact with the endzone.<br>However the time limits between points will not commence until the discussion is<br>resolved.</li>
<li>Calling Fouls, Infractions and Violations<br>15.1 Calling a breach or turnover (15)<br>Note<br>A player that makes a foul, violation, infraction, or turnover call must have<br>reasonable grounds to think that a breach or turnover might have occurred, but<br>they do not have to be certain that it has occurred.<br>If a player believes that they have reasonable grounds to think that a breach or<br>turnover might have occurred, they may call a stoppage (without making a specific<br>call) to enable players to discuss the situation and determine what did occur and<br>the appropriate outcome.<br>15.2 Accidental Contact (15.1)<br>Note<br>Non-minor contact that occurs accidentally is still a foul – it does not need to be<br>intentional. In fact there should be no intentional contact in Ultimate.<br>15.3 Infractions stopping play (15.2)<br>Note<br>Play does not stop for an infraction call. However travel and marking infractions<br>can lead to a stoppage if, for example, after a travel infraction a completed pass is<br>thrown, after an egregious marking infraction, or after a contested infraction call.<br>15.4 Informing opponent of a breach (15.4)<br>Note<br>If a breach is committed and not called, the player committing the breach should<br>inform the opponent or their team. However play must not be stopped to do so.<br>15.5 Making Infraction Calls (15.5)<br>Note<br>Only the thrower may call marking infractions, except in the case of a double<br>team. For marking infractions excluding double team, if other players notice a<br>marking infraction they may alert the thrower of this, however this call will have<br>no effect. The thrower may subsequently make the call themselves, in which case<br>the opposition should respond accordingly.<br>21Any offensive player may make a double team call, however if the call is not made<br>by the thrower, the call should be made loud enough for the thrower and marker<br>to hear. If the thrower echoes a double team call made by a teammate, this should<br>be treated as the same double team call (eg the stall count needs only to be<br>reduced one time.)<br>Any opposing player may make a travel infraction call, however if the call is not<br>made by the marker, the call should be made loud enough for the thrower and<br>marker to hear.<br>15.6 Calling a breach immediately (15.8)<br>Note<br>If a player who is unable to make the call recognises it, such as a receiver in the case<br>of a straddle, the breach can still be called once the player who can make the call<br>recognises it (ie the thrower in this example). However if, for example, the marker<br>recognises that the thrower has established a pivot at the incorrect spot, they cannot<br>wait until the stall count gets to 6 before they call a travel.<br>In addition, if a player had a reasonable opportunity to recognise that a breach had<br>occurred, but continued play as if no breach had occurred, they should not make the<br>call later on. For example if the thrower establishes a pivot at the incorrect spot, and<br>the marker starts the stall count, then once the stall count reaches 6, the marker<br>should not call travel for the pivot having been established at the incorrect spot,<br>even if they do not notice until the stall count reaches 6.<br>If play has stopped for a discussion, a player can still make a call as part of the<br>discussion.<br>15.7 Initiating a stoppage incorrectly (15.9)<br>Note<br>Extra<br>For example, if a defender tells a receiver to stop play, but play was not supposed to<br>have stopped and a pass to the receiver results in a turnover, the disc is returned to<br>the thrower and the stall count would resume at “Stalling 1” as per rule 9.5.1.<br>If there is disagreement over who initiated the stoppage incorrectly, then the disc<br>should be returned to the last non-disputed thrower.<br>15.8 Contesting a call (15.10)<br>Note<br>If, for example, the player against whom the breach was called thinks that the breach<br>was not significant enough to make a difference to the outcome of the action, they<br>can contest the call.<br>15.9 Retracting a call (15.11)<br>Note<br>If, for example, the marker calls a foul against the thrower, and after discussion the<br>marker retracts their call, the stall count would resume at “Stalling 1” as per rule<br>9.5.1<br>15.10 Resolving multiple breaches (15.12)<br>Note<br>For example, the marker calls an offensive foul on the thrower during the throw,<br>then later a receiver calls a defensive foul on a defender during the reception on an<br>incomplete pass. The fouls are resolved in reverse sequence. First, the receiving foul<br>is resolved (here, assumed accepted), granting possession to the offensive receiver,<br>then the throwing foul is resolved (here, assumed accepted), returning the disc to<br>the thrower. The earlier infraction (offensive foul on the thrower) takes precedence<br>over the later infraction (defensive foul on the receiver), resulting in the disc<br>returning to the original thrower. †<br>If the disc is returned to the thrower, the stall count must be resolved as per rule<br>9.5.4.1.</li>
<li>Continuation after a Call<br>16.1 What occurs after play continues in these scenarios (16.2)<br>What<br>Result<br>Why<br>What<br>Result<br>Why<br>Extra<br>What<br>Result<br>Why<br>Extra<br>The marker calls a foul against the thrower and then the thrower attempts a pass.<br>The pass is incomplete.<br>The turn over stands. Play does not need to stop.<br>Rule 16.2.4.1. – the team that called the foul gained possession so play continues.<br>The thrower calls a foul against the marker during the act of throwing. The throw<br>comes out fine and heads straight for its intended target - an unguarded offensive<br>player. The offensive player drops an easy catch.<br>The turnover stands. Play restarts with a check.<br>Rule 16.3. – the team that called the foul has lost possession, however the foul did<br>not actually affect the turnover – that was caused by the player dropping an easy<br>catch.<br>If the foul actually caused the throw to change direction or come out ‘wobbly’ then it<br>is reasonable that the foul affected play. Therefore the disc should go back to the<br>thrower, as per rule 16.2.4.2.1.<br>A Pick occurs in the stack on the left of the field at the same time the disc is thrown<br>down the right side of the field - the disc is in the air at the time of the call. An<br>offensive player catches the disc.<br>The completion stands and the player who called Pick gets to move where they think<br>they should have been.<br>Rule 16.3. - The Pick did not affect the possession.<br>If the offensive player had dropped the disc, this would be a turnover (16.2.4.1.)<br>If the pick was called before the throw and neither the pick nor the pick call affected<br>the play - the turnover stands (16.3).<br>16.2 Call affecting the play (16.2, 16.3)<br>Result<br>An event (including a foul, violation, injury) or call affects the outcome if the<br>outcome would have been meaningfully different had it not occurred. For example, a<br>call affected the play if a receiver is aware that the call has been made before the<br>throw and therefore slows down and fails to complete the pass.<br>During a stoppage to discuss these situations it is reasonable for a player to ask the<br>opposition if they think the event or call affected the outcome. If the opposition<br>thinks that it was affected, they should be able to provide some form of valid<br>justification.<br>16.3 Foul by the marker before a throw (16.2)<br>Note<br>Extra<br>If the thrower calls a foul before they are in the act of throwing, play must stop. If<br>the thrower does incorrectly continue play, the disc must come back to the thrower<br>unless 16.3 applies - this applies to both a completed pass, and a turnover.<br>If the thrower is fouled before the throw, but the foul continues to occur during the<br>throw, then 16.2 applies.<br>If the foul occurs before the throw, but the thrower waits to call the foul during the<br>act of throwing, 15.9 applies.<br>16.4 Pick&#x2F;Foul not involving the thrower called during the act of throwing<br>(16.2)<br>Note<br>Unlike in previous version of the rules, continuation does not apply to calls made<br>(not involving the thrower) during the act of throwing.<br>So if a foul is called by the dump receiver while the thrower is in the act of throwing,<br>play should stop immediately. If the thrower continues the throw, with no impact<br>23from the foul call, the result of the pass can stand as per 16.3.<br>However if the thrower heard the foul call while they were throwing, and this<br>impacted their throw and the pass was incomplete, 16.3 would not apply and<br>therefore the disc would be returned to the thrower.<br>Additionally if a pick is called while the thrower is in the act of throwing, and the<br>thrower attempted to stop the throw as a result of the pick call, and the pass is<br>incomplete, the disc would be returned to the thrower.<br>16.5 Play on called before possession established (16.2.4.1)<br>Note<br>If “play-on” is called before possession is established, and then the team that called<br>the breach does not gain&#x2F;retain possession, the “play on” call should be ignored and<br>play should stop. The players involved must still determine if the breach actually<br>affected the outcome, before determining whether the play should stand.<br>16.6 Play on not called (16.2.4.1)<br>Note<br>Any player recognizing that play should continue without a stoppage should<br>announce “play on”. †<br>If the player who called the breach does not announce “play on” and the opposing<br>team is uncertain whether play should continue, the opposing team has the option to<br>stop play by calling “violation”. †<br>16.7 Team that gains&#x2F;retains possession can choose to stop play (16.2.4.1)<br>Note<br>If the team that called the foul gains or retains possession, but the foul has impacted<br>on their ability to continue play, they can call an indirect foul once possession has<br>been established. This will stop play and enable them to make up any positional<br>disadvantage caused by the foul.<br>16.8 Foul called before possession is established (16.3)<br>Note<br>If an offensive receiver calls foul on contact that occurs before possession is<br>established, they can continue to make a play for the disc. If the defender stops to<br>discuss the foul call or to contest the foul call, play still does not stop until<br>possession is established. After possession is established play should stop, but as per<br>16.2.4.1 if the receiver catches the pass, the catch will stand.<br>16.9 More than one pass (16.3)<br>Note<br>There is no specific limit on how many passes can occur before 16.3 no longer<br>applies. However once more than one pass has been completed, it becomes<br>increasingly unlikely that the event, or call, will not affect the outcome.</li>
<li>Fouls<br>17.1 Minor Contact involving hands&#x2F;arms (17)<br>Note<br>Contact with an opponent’s extended arms or hands that are about to, or already<br>are, contacting the disc is not considered to be minor contact.<br>Contact to the throwers hand during the throwing motion is not considered to be<br>minor contact.<br>17.2 Dangerous play (17.1)<br>Note<br>Dangerous Play fouls can be called before an event to avoid a potential collision e.g. a<br>defender runs&#x2F;layouts in a way that an accident would occur if the offence were to<br>continue. When this occurs it is correct to not make a play on the disc &amp; to call a<br>‘dangerous play’ foul.<br>Players calling a Dangerous Play foul before a potential incident need to have<br>reasonable grounds for doing so. They should actually be able to see the oncoming<br>24Extra<br>Extra<br>player and have some reason to believe that player will not avoid contact – this could<br>include a previous history of that player to not avoid contact.<br>You cannot call dangerous play if you feel you could have made a play on the disc,<br>but that would have resulted in you initiating contact. In that instance, you should<br>just refrain from making the play.<br>The following are non-exhaustive examples of dangerous play: †<br>• significantly colliding with a mostly stationary opponent,<br>• jumping into a group of mostly stationary players,<br>• diving around or through a player that results in contact with a player’s back<br>or legs,<br>• running without looking when there is a likelihood of other players<br>occupying the space into which the player is traveling,<br>• jumping or otherwise leaving the ground where it is likely that a significant<br>collision will result,<br>• wild or uncontrolled throwing motions,<br>• initiating contact with a player’s head,<br>• initiating contact with an airborne player’s lower body that prevents them<br>from landing on their feet, and<br>• jumping right in front of a sprinting player in a manner where contact is<br>unavoidable<br>17.3 Teammate causes a foul (17.2)<br>Note<br>If Player A initiates contact with an opponent (Player B) that is the cause for Player B<br>contacting Player A’s teammate (Player C), then Player C cannot call a foul on Player<br>B as they did not initiate the contact.<br>17.4 Receiving fouls when it is unclear the disc was catchable (17.2)<br>What<br>Result<br>Extra<br>A player on offence is chasing after a long throw and is tripped over, while running,<br>by the defence. It is unclear if the offence player would have been able to get to the<br>disc had there been no foul.<br>If the offence player believes the defence initiated the non-minor contact they can<br>call a foul.<br>If the defence player accepts that they fouled the offence player, but they do not<br>believe the offence player had a reasonable chance at catching the disc, they may<br>invoke rule 16.3 and try to seek agreement that the result of the play should stand.<br>If the players cannot agree what would most likely have occurred in the play, the disc<br>must be returned to the thrower and the players return to where they were when<br>the disc was released (rule 1.12 and 10.2.2).<br>If it is clear to other players that the offence player did not have any chance at<br>making the catch had there been no foul, they should encourage the offence player<br>to let the turnover stand.<br>If the foul is accepted and it is agreed that it did affect the play, the offence player<br>gains possession where the foul occurred, not where they would have caught the<br>pass.<br>17.5 Receiving fouls (17.2)<br>Note<br>A receiving foul can be deemed to have occurred if any player involved in the foul is<br>attempting to make contact with the disc in anyway i.e. to catch it or block it.<br>Non minor contact that occurs directly after the attempt at the disc (i.e. a defender<br>catches the disc and then collides with an offence player) is considered to be a<br>receiving foul. However contact with the opponent’s arms after the block occurs is<br>not a sufficient basis for a foul as per rule 17.2.1.1.<br>25Extra<br>If the disc is in the air but the players involved in the foul were running to receive or<br>defend the next pass after possession has been established, this should be treated as<br>an Indirect foul (rule 17.8).<br>An accepted offensive receiving foul is a turnover (rule 17.2.2); however an accepted<br>indirect foul by the offence is not (rule 17.8.2).<br>If players have dived to make a play at the disc, the disc is contacted, but not caught,<br>and then one of the players attempts to make a second attempt but they are<br>obstructed by the player who had dived on the ground, this is not a foul by the<br>obstructing player, unless they deliberately move to obstruct the second attempt (in<br>which case, this could be a violation of rule 12.5.1 even if no contact occurs)<br>17.6 End zone possession after an accepted defensive receiving foul (17.2.2)<br>Note<br>Extra<br>After an accepted defensive receiving foul in the offense’s attacking end zone, the<br>receiver gets possession of the disc in the end zone. The disc is checked in there,<br>and they must then walk to the nearest spot on the goal line, as per 14.2. All players<br>may move once the disc is checked in, and the marker may only start the stall count<br>once the pivot is established at the goal line.<br>If the receiver drops the disc to the ground as they walk to the goal line, this is a<br>turnover as the play is live.<br>17.7 Strip Fouls (17.3)<br>Note<br>Extra<br>A player may not call a strip if they had only momentary contact with or lacked<br>control of the disc prior to an opponent contacting the disc.<br>If a defender hits the disc in flight before it is caught by the receiver, and that contact<br>with the disc causes the receiver to drop the pass, that is not a strip. The defender is<br>allowed to hit a disc in flight, when they hit a disc that has been caught by a receiver,<br>that is when it can be treated as a strip foul.<br>17.8 Strip foul on Callahan attempt (17.3.2)<br>Note<br>If an accepted strip foul occurs where the offence causes the defence to drop a pass<br>they have intercepted in the defences attacking end zone, this should be treated as a<br>goal for the defence.<br>17.9 Blocking Fouls (17.4)<br>Note<br>Every player has space reserved in the direction of their movement. The size of this<br>space depends on a lot of things (speed, direction of view, playing surface, etc) and is<br>as large as the answer to the question “if a tree suddenly materialized in this space,<br>could the player avoid contact (without a manoeuvre risking the health of their<br>joints)?”<br>Moving in a way that this space becomes unreasonably large (running full speed with<br>your eyes closed without checking frequently where you are going would be an<br>extreme example) is considered reckless.<br>If two players have the same space reserved at the same time and contact occurs,<br>whoever initiated the contact is guilty of the foul.<br>Players are free to move any way they like as long as this does not cause an<br>unavoidable collision.<br>A collision is avoidable for a player if the player could have reacted in time and<br>avoided it, given the circumstances involving their speed and line of sight.<br>17.10 Force-out fouls (17.5)<br>Note<br>Force-out fouls do not only apply to an airborne player. If, for example, a receiver<br>catches a pass in the end zone, but before they are able to establish possession they<br>are fouled, and the foul means they lose control, but they are able to establish<br>possession in the central zone, that is a force-out foul and would result in a goal.<br>2617.11 Contact on releasing the disc (Defensive or Offensive foul) (17.6, 17.7)<br>Note<br>Extra<br>If the thrower moves into a non-moving marker who is legally positioned, this a foul<br>by the thrower. i.e. if the thrower moves into a space the marker has already<br>occupied when the thrower started the throwing motion, and the marker is not in<br>breach of; straddle, disc space, wrapping.<br>If a thrower intentionally makes contact with a legally positioned marker this is an<br>offensive foul and also a breach of the most important rule – Spirit of the Game.<br>If the marker is legally positioned and is moving their arm directly away from the<br>thrower, and the thrower initiates contact with the markers arm, this is a foul by the<br>offence.<br>17.12 Marking foul and double team (17.6.1.1)<br>Note<br>If a defender is legally marking the thrower and then a second defender commits a<br>double team, the second defender is deemed to be the illegally positioned defensive<br>player. Therefore it would only be non-minor contact between the thrower and the<br>second defender that would automatically result in a defensive throwing foul.<br>17.13 Making a ‘contact’ call (17.6.1.3)<br>What<br>Result<br>Extra<br>A defensive player initiates non-minor contact with the thrower prior to the act of<br>throwing, but the thrower does not wish to stop play.<br>The thrower can call a contact infraction as per rule 17.6.1.3. If accepted, play does<br>not stop, but the stall count must be resumed at 1.<br>The thrower may also choose to call a foul (rule 17.6) on this contact, in which case<br>play stops.<br>If the thrower accidentally calls “Contact” when the contact occurred during the<br>throwing motion this should be treated as foul as per rule 17.6.<br>Contact should only be called when the contact is non minor – e.g. it affects the<br>ability of the thrower to freely pivot, fake, or prepare to throw.<br>For minor contact, the thrower may choose to call a disc space infraction.<br>17.14 Indirect Fouls (17.8)<br>What<br>Result<br>Why<br>Extra<br>An offensive player accidentally runs into a defensive player and knocks them over.<br>The thrower has not released the disc. The defensive player calls a foul.<br>Play stops. The defensive player makes up any positional disadvantage caused by the<br>foul (Rule17.8).<br>The foul did not occur before, during, or directly after, an attempt to catch the disc<br>and is therefore not a receiving foul.<br>If the disc had been in the air when the foul occurred, but the foul did not occur<br>before, during, or directly after, an attempt by those players to catch the disc, then<br>play would continue until possession was established. If the offensive team retained<br>possession, the defensive player should then make up any positional disadvantage<br>caused by the foul and play would restart with a check (16.3.2).<br>If the offense commits a foul after establishing possession in the air, but the foul was<br>caused by actions not related to the process of making the catch (eg while<br>attempting to intentionally land in the end zone), this should be treated as an indirect<br>foul.<br>17.15 Offsetting receiving fouls (17.9.2)<br>Note<br>There are times when both players have a right to a space and neither player can be<br>deemed to have initiated contact. In these circumstances, if body contact occurs that<br>affects the outcome of the play, this is to be treated as an Offsetting Foul (17.9.2).<br>The disc shall be returned to the thrower (unless 17.9.2.1 applies).<br>27Extra<br>Minor contact may occur as two or more players move towards a single point<br>simultaneously but this should not be considered a foul.<br>Players involved in these incidents should be mindful that they often do not have the<br>best perspective on who initiated the contact and should ask nearby players for their<br>perspective.<br>If two opposing players both cause non-dangerous contact by jumping to the same<br>point simultaneously to catch a pass, but one player catches the pass before the<br>contact occurs, the result of the play will stand. However if an offsetting foul is<br>called, any players that had fallen over as a result of the contact will be able to stand<br>up before play resumes.</li>
<li>Infractions and Violations<br>18.1 Starting from the incorrect number (18.1.1.1.5)<br>Note<br>If a fast count infraction is called because the marker started the stall count from the<br>incorrect number (e.g. when they are not within 3 metres of the thrower, or after<br>moving more than 3 metres from the thrower) the marker should automatically<br>reset the stall count at the correct number, even if that means reducing the count by<br>more than 2 seconds.<br>If a marking infraction is called before the stall count reaches 2, the marker must<br>reduce the stall count to 1 (it should not result in a “negative stall count”).<br>18.2 Disc Space (18.1.1.3)<br>Note<br>The thrower may choose to call “disc space” for both straddle and wrapping<br>violations as appropriate. However, the thrower may also choose to call the more<br>specific violation for clearer communication to the marker about what needs to be<br>corrected. †<br>18.3 Wrapping (18.1.1.4)<br>Note<br>The marker is allowed to stand with arms stretched out to attempt to ‘force’ the<br>thrower to throw in a particular direction, as long as they are legally positioned.<br>18.4 Double team (18.1.1.5)<br>What<br>Result<br>Note<br>Extra<br>Two or more defensive players are within 3 metres of the thrower and are not<br>guarding any other players.<br>The offence may call “double team” unless all “extra” defenders can claim they are<br>guarding (within three meters of an offensive player and are reacting to that offensive<br>player) another offensive player, or if they are merely running across the area.<br>In zone defence it is common for a defender to come within 3 metres of the<br>thrower when another offensive player enters into that same area. To avoid a double<br>team the defender must be guarding that offensive player, which can include<br>attempting to stop a pass to that offensive player.<br>If the defence does not believe they have committed a double team infraction they<br>may call contest and play shall stop – they cannot just ignore the call.<br>Any number of defensive players are allowed to guard the same offensive receiver.<br>When a double team is called and is accepted, the marker must first wait for the<br>illegal positioning to be corrected (18.1.4) and then resume the stall count with the<br>number last fully uttered before the call, minus one (1) (18.1.3).<br>Any offensive player may make a double team call, however if the call is not made by<br>the thrower, the call should be made loud enough for the thrower and marker to<br>hear. If the thrower echoes a double team call made by a teammate, this should be<br>28treated as the same double team call (eg the stall count needs only to be reduced<br>one time.)<br>If a defender intentionally double teams the thrower, with no regard for any other<br>offensive players, and gets a block, this can be addressed by rule 1.2.1.<br>18.5 Contested Marking Infractions (18.1.2.1)<br>Note<br>After a contested marking infraction where a pass has been completed, it is the<br>marker’s responsibility to announce if play was affected for the purpose of rule 16.3.<br>In limited situations for contested marking infraction calls, when the marker diverts<br>their attention away from marking while reasonably and quickly assessing the<br>conditions to the thrower’s marking infraction call, the marker could determine that<br>play was affected. For example, the thrower calls straddle, and while the marker is<br>looking at their feet to assess their marking position, the thrower completes a throw<br>around the marker. If the marker subsequently contests the straddle because they<br>assessed that they weren’t committing a marking infraction, they could claim that play<br>was affected and the disc should be returned to the thrower. †<br>18.6 Resuming the stall count after Marking Infractions (18.1.3)<br>Note<br>Extra<br>When a marking infraction is called, the marker should immediately stop counting.<br>The defence should then correct the infraction and the marker can then resume the<br>count at the appropriate number. †<br>To resume the stall count with the number last uttered before the call minus one, is<br>the same as subtracting two seconds from the stall count eg. Stalling One, Two,<br>Three, Fast Count, Two, Three etc.<br>If more than one marking infraction is called during the same thrower possession it<br>does not impact how the stall count is adjusted – the marker must still resume the<br>stall count with the number last fully uttered before the call, minus one (1).<br>18.7 Marker does not adjust the stall count after a marking infraction<br>(18.1.5)<br>Extra<br>If the marker does not adjust the stall count the thrower should call a fast count<br>infraction (18.1.1.1). If the marker still fails to adjust the stall count the thrower may<br>call a Violation. Play stops and the breach should be explained to the marker.<br>18.8 Egregious marking infractions (18.1.5.3)<br>Note<br>This includes flagrant breaches such as four defenders being around the thrower, the<br>marker completely surrounding the thrower with their arms, and the marker only<br>taking two seconds to reach “stalling 6”.<br>18.9 Passing while slowing down after catching the disc (18.2.2.1)<br>What<br>Result<br>Extra<br>An offensive player catches the disc while running and passes the disc while still in<br>the process of slowing down, and after two additional points of contact with the<br>ground.<br>This is allowed, provided that the player was attempting to slow down as quickly as<br>possible and they maintain contact with the playing field throughout the throwing<br>motion.<br>Once the thrower has released the disc they do not need to come to a stop.<br>18.10 Making a Travel call (18.2.5)<br>Note<br>The defence should not call travel under section 18.2 for failing to slow down unless<br>they have evidence that the player was not trying to stop while in possession of the<br>disc. In particular:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>a player who catches and throws the disc while entirely in the air does not<br>need to slow down</li>
<li>the length of a player’s strides should decrease as they slow down<br>29Extra</li>
<li>a player is not allowed to maintain a constant speed while catching and<br>throwing the disc, unless they catch and throw in the air, or a maximum of<br>two additional points of contact with the ground are made after the catch and<br>before they release the pass</li>
<li>it should never take a player more than 5 steps to come to a stop<br>Unless the defence has evidence along those lines, they should not call travel.<br>Players should also take into consideration that a player may change direction after<br>they have established a pivot – any change of direction after a pivot has been<br>established should not be called a travel.<br>In some situations, a receiver may need to maintain speed briefly or change direction<br>slightly to avoid contact with a diving defender or to jump over a player on the<br>ground. This is expected in such situations and should not be considered a travel.<br>If the travel is caused solely by contact that is initiated by an opponent, this should<br>not be considered a travel.<br>If play has stopped, the thrower may change the part of their body that they have in<br>contact with the pivot spot. This is not a travel.<br>If a player aims to release a pass without attempting to stop in accordance with<br>18.2.2.1 but then change their mind and stop without releasing the pass after more<br>than two additional points of contact, this is a travel infraction and the travel is<br>deemed to have occurred when they failed to reduce their speed.<br>A player is deemed to be changing direction after catching the disc if there is<br>sideways movement of their centre of mass before a pivot is established, or their<br>pivot point is not established where their foot would naturally have stopped based<br>on their previous motion.<br>18.11 Run up for a throw (18.2.5.3)<br>Note<br>After a pull, a turnover not in the central zone, or after momentum causes a player<br>to leave the playing field, the thrower cannot take a run up to make a pass whereby<br>they start their wind up or throwing action before they have established a pivot<br>point.<br>18.12 Tipping (18.2.5.5)<br>Note<br>Any contact with the disc that is not a clean catch can be considered tipping (the<br>rules also use the terms bobbling, fumbling, and delaying).<br>If a player intentionally tips the disc to themselves into the endzone so that they<br>can score, this is a travel infraction.<br>If a player tips the disc so a team-mate can catch it in the end zone, this is a goal.<br>If a player fumbles with a disc while catching it and finally manages to get control<br>over it in the end zone, this is a goal, unless the fumbling was intentional.<br>If they tip the disc solely in order to assist themselves to catch a disc that they<br>otherwise would not have been able to gain possession of, that is not a travel.<br>18.13 Continuing play after a Travel call (18.2.6)<br>What<br>Result<br>Extra<br>An accepted Travel infraction is called and the thrower has not released the disc.<br>Play does not stop. The thrower must establish the pivot at the correct spot as per<br>rule 18.2.6.<br>If accepted, all players, except the thrower, are free to move anywhere on the field.<br>Play does not stop, but the disc is live, so it is still subject to a turnover (for example<br>if the thrower drops it). †<br>If the defense does not indicate to the thrower where the travel occurred, or the<br>thrower wishes to contest the location of an indicated spot, the thrower should<br>announce “violation”, stopping play, and explain that the spot was incorrectly&#x2F;not<br>indicated. †<br>30If the travel call is contested players should return to where they were when the<br>travel was called.<br>If the pass is completed, play stops and the disc is returned to the thrower.<br>18.14 Resuming play after a travel violation (18.2.7)<br>Note<br>Extra<br>After a travel violation the thrower must return to the location occupied at the time<br>of the infraction, not to the spot they should have been at.<br>After a turnover out-of-bounds, if the thrower is called for a travel because they<br>established the pivot on the side line, instead of on the goal line, and they have<br>thrown a completed pass, play must stop. The disc must be returned to the thrower<br>and the disc must be checked in where the infraction occurred, ie on the side line.<br>Once the disc is checked in, they must move to the goal line to establish a pivot at<br>the correct spot. All other players may move once the disc is checked in. The disc is<br>considered to be dead until the pivot is established.<br>18.15 Calling a Pick (18.3.1)<br>Note<br>Extra<br>A pick should only be called if the obstructed player is within 3 metres of the player<br>they were guarding at the time they were obstructed. However they do not need to<br>be less than 3 metres away at the time of the call because the obstruction may cause<br>this distance to quickly grow before the call can be made.<br>Obstruction may result from contact with, or the need to avoid, the obstructing<br>player.<br>A pick cannot be called by the offense.<br>A pick should not be called by a defender who was obstructed while attempting to<br>make a play on the disc, that is not related to their ability to move towards&#x2F;with the<br>player they are guarding (however a defender may call a violation under Rule 12.7 if<br>applicable).<br>After an accepted pick call the picked defender catches up the relative position lost<br>because of the pick. If they were trailing by 2.5 metres, then they get to catch back<br>up to 2.5 metres away, but they do not get to set up right next to the offensive<br>player. †<br>If the offence retains possession after an accepted pick, the picked defender may go<br>to the agreed place where they would have been without the obstruction. All other<br>players, including the offensive player that the defender was guarding, should be<br>located according to Rule 10.2.<br>If the offence retains possession after a contested pick, all players, including the<br>player who made the pick call, should be located according to Rule 10.2<br>If the defender does delay the pick call according to 18.3.1.1, the pick is still deemed<br>to have been called when it was actually called, and not when it occurred. If the<br>defender waits longer then two seconds, 15.9 applies.</li>

<li>Safety Stoppages<br>19.1 Injury substitution (19.1.2)<br>Notes<br>The injured player must choose one of the two options provided; however if their<br>team has no time-outs remaining, they must be substituted.<br>To ‘charge their own team with a time-out’ means that a time-out is deducted from<br>those allowed for that half, however the team does not get the opportunity to<br>discuss tactics or have a break as per a standard 75 second time-out.<br>If there is a dispute over who caused the injury, then the 19.1.3 is deemed to apply.<br>If Player A is substituted for an injury, and then an additional injury substitution is<br>required during the same point, Player A can return to play.<br>If an injury stoppage is called during a team time-out, the opposing team must be<br>notified as soon as the injury is discovered.<br>3119.2 Injury stoppage and continued play (19.1.6)<br>Note<br>If an injury is called while the disc is in the air, as a result of a serious injury, and<br>players stop to care for the severely injured player, it is reasonable to treat this as a<br>technical stoppage and allow the disc to be returned to the thrower.<br>19.3 Condition that endangers players (19.2.1)<br>Note<br>Extra<br>A player can call a Technical Stoppage to remove or adjust a potentially dangerous<br>object (i.e. rock, metal, wood piece, glass) found in the playing field.<br>A receiver is not required to continue playing through a dangerous situation, such as<br>a child wandering onto the field. In that case, the receiver should stop making a play<br>on the disc in order to prioritize the safety of themselves and others, and the disc<br>will be returned to the thrower once the dangerous situation is rectified. †<br>19.4 Open or bleeding wounds (19.2.1)<br>Note<br>A bleeding or exposed open wound is “effectively addressed” if it is covered with a<br>dressing sturdy enough to withstand the demands of activity and able to prevent<br>bodily fluids from coming in contact with other players. Any player whose clothing<br>has blood on it must have the affected areas disinfected or must change the clothing<br>before returning to play. Whether a player may return to play is determined by<br>appropriate medical staff. If medical staff is not available, captains and coaches may<br>agree that a wound has been effectively covered and any clothing issues have been<br>addressed. †<br>The stoppage should only be used to address the blood issue.<br>19.5 Technical Stoppage for a severely damaged disc (19.2.2)<br>Note<br>A severely damaged disc is one that is cracked, torn, deeply gouged, creased,<br>punctured or badly warped (“tacoed”); a slightly warped, wet or dirty disc does not<br>qualify.<br>However an existing stoppage may be extended to correct a warped disc (rule 10.3).</li>
<li>Time-outs<br>20.1 Calling a time-out during play (20.3)<br>Note<br>If the thrower must&#x2F;can move to establish a pivot at a different spot to where they<br>established possession, they can call a time-out before they establish the pivot at that<br>spot. This means that if the thrower picks up the disc after a turnover, and the<br>turnover location is not in the central zone, they can call a time-out straight away. If<br>they do so, they must place the disc at the spot where they will establish a pivot<br>after the time-out.<br>20.2 Delay of play after a time-out (20.3)<br>Note<br>Extra<br>The delay of game rules from section 10.5 also apply to the restart of play after a<br>time-out<br>For games played using the Appendix, refer to the relevant section for specific<br>timings that apply<br>20.3 Time-out between points or during a stoppage (20.4)<br>Note<br>If a team calls “time-out” between points, or during a stoppage, but their team has<br>none remaining, then the time-out call has no affect.<br>32</li>
